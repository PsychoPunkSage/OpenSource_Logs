# **List Widgets**

>>> Sometimes we want to display a list of elements in a certain arrangement. `gtk::ListBox` and `gtk::FlowBox` are two container widgets which allow you to do this. `ListBox` describes a vertical list and `FlowBox` describes a grid.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/1/main.rs

```rust
    // Create a `ListBox` and add labels with integers from 0 to 100
    let list_box = ListBox::new();
    for number in 0..=100 {
        let label = Label::new(Some(&number.to_string()));
        list_box.append(&label);
    }
```

We cannot display so many widgets at once. Therefore, we add `ListBox` to a `gtk::ScrolledWindow`. Now we can scroll through our elements.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/1/main.rs

```rust
    let scrolled_window = ScrolledWindow::builder()
        .hscrollbar_policy(PolicyType::Never) // Disable horizontal scrolling
        .min_content_width(360)
        .child(&list_box)
        .build();

    // Create a window
    let window = ApplicationWindow::builder()
        .application(app)
        .title("My GTK App")
        .default_width(600)
        .default_height(300)
        .child(&scrolled_window)
        .build();

    // Present window
    window.present();
```

## **Views**

>> However, we currently create one widget per element. Since each widget takes up a bit of resources, many of them can lead to slow and unresponsive user interfaces. Depending on the widget type even thousands of elements might not be a problem.

We use scalable lists instead!

* The **model** holds our data, filters it and describes its order.
* The **list item factory** defines how the data transforms into widgets.
* The **view** specifies how the widgets are then arranged.

We start by defining and filling up our model. The model is an instance of `gio::ListStore`. The main limitation here is that `gio::ListStore` only accepts GObjects. So let's create a custom GObject `IntegerObject` that which is initialized with a number.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/integer_object/mod.rs

```rust
glib::wrapper! {
    pub struct IntegerObject(ObjectSubclass<imp::IntegerObject>);
}

impl IntegerObject {
    pub fn new(number: i32) -> Self {
        Object::builder().property("number", number).build()
    }
}
```

* This number represents the internal state of `IntegerObject`.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/integer_object/imp.rs

```rust
// Object holding the state
#[derive(Properties, Default)]
#[properties(wrapper_type = super::IntegerObject)]
pub struct IntegerObject {
    #[property(get, set)]
    number: Cell<i32>,
}
```

We now fill the model with integers from 0 to 100 000. Please note that models only takes care of the data. Neither `Label` nor any other widget is mentioned here.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/main.rs

```rust
    // Create a `Vec<IntegerObject>` with numbers from 0 to 100_000
    let vector: Vec<IntegerObject> = (0..=100_000).map(IntegerObject::new).collect();

    // Create new model
    let model = gio::ListStore::new::<IntegerObject>();

    // Add the vector to the model
    model.extend_from_slice(&vector);
```

The `ListItemFactory` takes care of the widgets as well as their relationship to the model. Here, we use the `SignalListItemFactory` which emits a signal for every relevant step in the life of a `ListItem`. The "setup" signal will be emitted when new widgets have to be created. We connect to it to create a `Label` for every requested widget.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/main.rs

```rust
    let factory = SignalListItemFactory::new();
    factory.connect_setup(move |_, list_item| {
        let label = Label::new(None);
        list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem")
            .set_child(Some(&label));
    });
```

In the "bind" step we bind the data in our model to the individual list items.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/main.rs

```rust
    factory.connect_bind(move |_, list_item| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from `ListItem`
        let integer_object = list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem")
            .item()
            .and_downcast::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The item has to be an `IntegerObject`.");

        // Get `Label` from `ListItem`
        let label = list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem")
            .child()
            .and_downcast::<Label>()
            .expect("The child has to be a `Label`.");

        // Set "label" to "number"
        label.set_label(&integer_object.number().to_string());
    });
```

We only want single items to be selectable, so we choose `SingleSelection`. The other options would have been `MultiSelection` or `NoSelection`. Then we pass the model and the factory to the `ListView`.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/main.rs

```rust
    let selection_model = SingleSelection::new(Some(model));
    let list_view = ListView::new(Some(selection_model), Some(factory));
```

Every `ListView` has to be a direct child of a `ScrolledWindow`, so we are adding it to one.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/2/main.rs

```rust
    let scrolled_window = ScrolledWindow::builder()
        .hscrollbar_policy(PolicyType::Never) // Disable horizontal scrolling
        .min_content_width(360)
        .child(&list_view)
        .build();

    // Create a window
    let window = ApplicationWindow::builder()
        .application(app)
        .title("My GTK App")
        .default_width(600)
        .default_height(300)
        .child(&scrolled_window)
        .build();

    // Present window
    window.present();
```

We might want to increase the number every time we activate its row. For that we first add the method `increase_number` to our `IntegerObject`.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/3/integer_object/mod.rs

```rust
impl IntegerObject {
    pub fn new(number: i32) -> Self {
        Object::builder().property("number", number).build()
    }

    pub fn increase_number(self) {
        self.set_number(self.number() + 1);
    }
}
```

In order to interact with our `ListView`, we connect to its "activate" signal.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/3/main.rs

```rust
    list_view.connect_activate(move |list_view, position| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from model
        let model = list_view.model().expect("The model has to exist.");
        let integer_object = model
            .item(position)
            .and_downcast::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The item has to be an `IntegerObject`.");

        // Increase "number" of `IntegerObject`
        integer_object.increase_number();
    });
```

Now every time we activate an element, for example by double-clicking on it, the corresponding "number" property of the `IntegerObject` in the model will be increased by 1. However, just because the `IntegerObject` has been modified the corresponding `Label` does not immediately change. One naive approach would be to bind the properties in the "bind" step of the `SignalListItemFactory`.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/3/main.rs

```rust
    factory.connect_bind(move |_, list_item| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from `ListItem`
        let integer_object = list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem")
            .item()
            .and_downcast::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The item has to be an `IntegerObject`.");

        // Get `Label` from `ListItem`
        let label = list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem")
            .child()
            .and_downcast::<Label>()
            .expect("The child has to be a `Label`.");

        // Bind "label" to "number"
        integer_object
            .bind_property("number", &label, "label")
            .sync_create()
            .build();
    });
```
## **Expression**

>> Situations like these are so common that GTK offers an alternative to property binding: expressions. As a first step it allows us to remove the "bind" step. Let's see how the "setup" step now works.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/4/main.rs

```rust
    factory.connect_setup(move |_, list_item| {
        // Create label
        let label = Label::new(None);
        let list_item = list_item
            .downcast_ref::<ListItem>()
            .expect("Needs to be ListItem");
        list_item.set_child(Some(&label));

        // Bind `list_item->item->number` to `label->label`
        list_item
            .property_expression("item")
            .chain_property::<IntegerObject>("number")
            .bind(&label, "label", Widget::NONE);
    });
```

An expression provides a way to describe references to values. One interesting part here is that these references can be several steps away. This allowed us in the snippet above to bind the property "number" of the property "item" of `list_item` to the property "label" of `label`.

It is also worth noting that at the "setup" stage there is no way of knowing which list item belongs to which label, simply because this changes as we scroll through the list. Here, another power of expressions becomes evident.<br>Expressions allow us to describe relationships between objects or properties that might not even exist yet. We just had to tell it to change the label whenever the number that belongs to it changes. That way, we also don't face the problem that multiple labels are bound to the same number. When we now activate a label, only the corresponding number visibly changes.

We can filter our model to only allow even numbers. We do that by passing it to a `gtk::FilterListModel` together with a `gtk::CustomFilter`

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/5/main.rs

```rust
    let filter = CustomFilter::new(move |obj| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from `glib::Object`
        let integer_object = obj
            .downcast_ref::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The object needs to be of type `IntegerObject`.");

        // Only allow even numbers
        integer_object.number() % 2 == 0
    });
    let filter_model = FilterListModel::new(Some(model), Some(filter.clone()));
```

Additionally, we can reverse the order of our model. Now we pass the filtered model to `gtk::SortListModel` together with `gtk::CustomSorter`.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/5/main.rs

```rust
    let sorter = CustomSorter::new(move |obj1, obj2| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from `glib::Object`
        let integer_object_1 = obj1
            .downcast_ref::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The object needs to be of type `IntegerObject`.");
        let integer_object_2 = obj2
            .downcast_ref::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The object needs to be of type `IntegerObject`.");

        // Get property "number" from `IntegerObject`
        let number_1 = integer_object_1.number();
        let number_2 = integer_object_2.number();

        // Reverse sorting order -> large numbers come first
        number_2.cmp(&number_1).into()
    });
    let sort_model = SortListModel::new(Some(filter_model), Some(sorter.clone()));
```

To ensure that our filter and sorter get updated when we modify the numbers, we call the changed method on them.

`Filesystem`: ...../list_widgets/5/main.rs

```rust
    list_view.connect_activate(move |list_view, position| {
        // Get `IntegerObject` from model
        let model = list_view.model().expect("The model has to exist.");
        let integer_object = model
            .item(position)
            .and_downcast::<IntegerObject>()
            .expect("The item has to be an `IntegerObject`.");

        // Increase "number" of `IntegerObject`
        integer_object.increase_number();

        // Notify that the filter and sorter have been changed
        filter.changed(FilterChange::Different);
        sorter.changed(SorterChange::Different);
    });
```

## **String List**

>> Often, all we want is to display a list of strings. However, if we either need to filter and sort our displayed data or have too many elements to be displayed by `ListBox`, we will still want to use a view. GTK provides a convenient model for this use case: `gtk::StringList`.

Let's see with a small example how to use this API. Filter and sorter is controlled by the factory, so nothing changes here. This is why we will skip this topic here.
