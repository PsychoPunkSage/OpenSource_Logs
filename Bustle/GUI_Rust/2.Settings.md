# **Settings**

>>> Every time we close the application all the settings and data of it is gone. Let's see how to use `gio::Settings` by storing the state of a `Switch` in it.

>>> At the very beginning we have to create a `GSchema` xml file in order to describe the kind of data our application plans to store in the settings.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/1/org.gtk_rs.Settings1.gschema.xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<schemalist>
  <schema id="org.gtk_rs.Settings1" path="/org/gtk_rs/Settings1/">
    <key name="is-switch-enabled" type="b">
      <default>false</default>
      <summary>Default switch state</summary>
    </key>
  </schema>
</schemalist>
```

* The `id` is the same **application id** we used when we created our application.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/1/main.rs

```rust
    // Create a new application
    let app = Application::builder().application_id(APP_ID).build();
```

<details>
<summary>Path</summary>

```
The `path` must start and end with a forward slash character ('/') and must not contain two sequential slash characters. When creating a `path`, we advise to take the `id`, replace the '.' with '/' and add '/' at the front and end of it.
```

</details>

We only want to store a single key with the `name` "is-switch-enabled". This is a boolean value so its `type` is "b" (see GVariant Format Strings for the other options). We also set its default value to `false` (see GVariant Text Format for the full syntax). Finally, we add a summary.


<details>
<summary>Copy and compile the schema</summary>

```
Linux/MacOS
```

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
cp org.gtk_rs.Settings1.gschema.xml $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
glib-compile-schemas $HOME/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
```

</details>

<br>Initialize the `Settings` object by specifying the application id.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/1/main.rs

```rust
    // Initialize settings
    let settings = Settings::new(APP_ID);
```

Then we get the settings key and use it when we create our `Switch`.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/1/main.rs

```rust
    // Get the last switch state from the settings
    let is_switch_enabled = settings.boolean("is-switch-enabled");

    // Create a switch
    let switch = Switch::builder()
        .margin_top(48)
        .margin_bottom(48)
        .margin_start(48)
        .margin_end(48)
        .valign(Align::Center)
        .halign(Align::Center)
        .state(is_switch_enabled)
        .build();
```

We assure that the switch state is stored in the settings whenever we click on it.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/1/main.rs

```rust
    switch.connect_state_set(move |_, is_enabled| {
        // Save changed switch state in the settings
        settings
            .set_boolean("is-switch-enabled", is_enabled)
            .expect("Could not set setting.");
        // Allow to invoke other event handlers
        glib::Propagation::Proceed
    });
```

The `Switch` now retains its state even after closing the application. But we can make this even better. The `Switch` has a property "active" and `Settings` allows us to bind properties to a specific setting. So let's do exactly that.

We can remove the `boolean` call before initializing the `Switch` as well as the `connect_state_set` call. We then bind the setting to the property by specifying the key, object and name of the property.

`Filesystem`: ...../settings/2/main.rs

```rust
    settings
        .bind("is-switch-enabled", &switch, "active")
        .build();
```

Whenever we have a property which nicely correspond to a setting, you probably want to bind it to it. In other cases, interacting with the settings via the getter and setter methods tends to be the right choice.
